# 1010-in-CPP
A (simplified...) 1010! game in C++. Made by me and OS.Giftia in boringness...

Still a simple program, with 3 selection to choose, and a 8*8 surface...

But the judgement part is flawless (I think), so it can provide something to some of you (I hope)...

Anyway, it's written in boringness so don't expect us to do any upgrade of something else...

## Enjoy the Game!
